This project was created as a part of the INSAID Career Launchpad Session to help HR Advisories to detect possible employees who may end up quitting the organization. The data was sourced from HRMS where the details of all past and present employees were being recorded for last 15 years.

In this project the outcome is a classification where we judge if the employee is likely to quit or not.
